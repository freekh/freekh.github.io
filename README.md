# CV
Hello there, this is the repo for my CV.
You can check it out a live version [here](https://freekh.github.io).

# Building
First, you'll need some packages in order to babelify the script:
```
yarn install
```

After that completes, you can build it like so:
```
yarn build
```
This will populate the `build` folder.


If you're planning on doing changes, you can watch for changes like this:
```
yarn watch
``` 

After that you should be able to simply open up the `index.html` file in any browser.
