# CV

Hello there, this is the repo for my CV.
You can check it out a live version [here](https://freekh.github.io).

# Building

First, you'll need some packages in order to babelify the script:

```
npm ci
```

After that completes, you can build it like so:

```
npm run build
```

This will populate the `build` folder.

If you're planning on doing changes, you can watch for changes like this:

```
npm run watch
```

After that you should be able to simply open up the `index.html` file in any browser.
